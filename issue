I just want to ask you some question,
but I can't find another way,
So I did like this, sorry.

first, Thank you for saving the project form old version.

but I still have some problem.
clang::InitializePreprocessor( preprocessor, po, pchContainerReader, frontendOptions);
everytime I run after this line, an error will occurred.

And witch the version of clang you use?
